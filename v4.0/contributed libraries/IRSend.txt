// Description: This lets you send IR signals using basic NEC protocol.

// A typical NEC protocol signal should follow this format:
// Start with a leading pulse and space, followed by an 8-bit(LSB) address and its bit inverted version.
// Then an 8-bit(LSB) command and its bit inverted version. Finally, end with a terminator.
// Some devices use all 16-bit to contain data instead of sending an inverted correction signal.
//
//       (16 Bursts)
//   Leading Pulse (9ms)            0 (On + Off)                Terminate Burst
