// Description: This library allows you to read the number of ticks of a pulse return.
// If no pulse is returned, then nil is returned.
// As this relies on ticks, it is not accurate enough for anything more than obstacle detection.
// When using Ultrasonic, a pulse takes approximately 1 tick to travel 160 mm (80 mm there and 80 mm back).
func pulseIn(pin: Pin, timeout: UInt32 = 500) -> UInt16?
