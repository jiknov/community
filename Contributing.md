We welcome any contributions to the site, demo apps, documentation or libraries for other people to share.

The rough structure of the folders are:

- contributed examples = a place to put example projects and code for other developers to learn from or to copy to their projects

- contributed libraries = NO LONGER USED - this was where libraries used to be contributed

- contributed unsafe modules = a place to keep the C/C++ source code for open sourced contributed modules. note: do not put the compiled binary modules (for distribution and use by developers) in here, they should go in "libraries"

- demo examples = examples code from the swift for arduino blog site

- learning examples = simple projects for learning basic use of the standard IDE and AVR hardware library, these are deliberately made to be like similar to the basic examples from the classic Arduino IDE, and they are also included with the IDE when first installed as learning examples

- libraries = this is where shared swift "library" files and shared binary modules are kept. These are automatically downloaded by the IDE and can be easily added to a developer's project by the "add libraries"
dialog inside the IDE (or by adding an import statement for binary modules). NOTE: see the readme file in that folder for more details

- S4A Elements Examples = these projects are intended for use with the kits that you can buy from the S4A Elements site

- v4.0 = NO LONGER USED - this was another location for contributed files in the past

- work in progress - a scratch area for projects, organised by contributor
